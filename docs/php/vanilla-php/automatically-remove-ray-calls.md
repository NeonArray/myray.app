# Automatically remove Ray calls

To avoid shipping your code with some `ray()` calls in it you can automate the removal of all `ray()` calls in your codebase.

## Rector
If you are already using [Rector](https://getrector.com/) this can be simply done by adding a rule to your `rector.php` config file:

```php
use Spatie\Ray\Rector\RemoveRayCallRector;

$rectorConfig->rule(RemoveRayCallRector::class);
```

## If you are not using Rector
If you are not using Rector you can use the script provided by the package:

```bash
./vendor/bin/remove-ray.sh <path>
```
