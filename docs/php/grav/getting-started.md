Grav is a modern, fast, easy and powerful Flat-File CMS powered by PHP, Markdown, Twig, and Symfony.

You can use Ray with [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/) using this third party package: https://github.com/trilbymedia/grav-plugin-grav-ray

Install the plugin via the [GPM](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/cli-console/grav-cli-gpm), through your system's terminal, navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

```bash
bin/gpm install grav-ray
```
