title: Using Ray With Ruby
weight: 1
---

You can use Ray with Ruby via this third party package:

[spatie/ruby-ray](https://github.com/spatie/ruby-ray)

The Ruby gem is still in active development. We haven't released a stable version just yet, but you can already install and play around with the `0.x` version.

To start using Ray in any Ruby project, install the `ruby-ray` gem.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-ray'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install ruby-ray
```

You should be able to use the `ray` function without any other steps.
