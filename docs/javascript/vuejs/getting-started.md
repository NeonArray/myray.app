title: Using Ray with VueJS
weight: 1
---

The third-party Vue package for Ray uses the [package for NodeJS](/docs/ray/v1/installation-in-your-project/nodejs) for
most core functionality. See the [NodeJS reference](/docs/ray/v1/usage/nodejs) for a full list of available methods.

Once the plugin is installed, you may access the helper function as `this.$ray()` from within your Vue components.
