You can use Ray with Vue using the third party package: 

[permafrost-dev/vue-ray](https://github.com/permafrost-dev/vue-ray)

The third-party Vue package for Ray uses the [package for Node.js](/docs/javascript/nodejs/getting-started) for
most core functionality. See the [Node.js reference](/docs/javascript/nodejs/getting-started) for a full list of available methods.

Once the plugin is installed, you may access the helper function as `this.$ray()` from within your Vue components.
