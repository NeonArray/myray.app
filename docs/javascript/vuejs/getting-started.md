title: Using Ray With VueJS
weight: 1

The third-party Vue package for Ray uses the [package for Node.js](/docs/javascript/nodejs/getting-started) for
most core functionality. See the [Node.js reference](/docs/javascript/nodejs/getting-started) for a full list of available methods.

Once the plugin is installed, you may access the helper function as `this.$ray()` from within your Vue components.
