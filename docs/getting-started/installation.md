## Sending your first call
To make sure everything is functioning correctly, just send a request to Ray from your application. The ray() command differs by language, but for PHP, you can write the following function and execute it in your application:

```php
ray('Hello world!');
```

```php
namespace App\Http\Front\Controllers;

use App\Domain\Docs\Models\Navigation;

class DocsController
{
    public function index()
    {
        $navigation = Navigation::build();
        $page = $navigation->topCategory->firstPage();

        return view('front.docs.index', compact('page'));
    }

    public function show(string $slug)
    {
        $page = sheets()->collection('docs')->get($slug);

        return view('front.docs.index', compact('page'));
    }
}
